# Employee-tracker-mysql
This project is a CLI-based employee management system that interacts with a MySQL database. Using Node.js and the Inquirer package, the application provides an easy-to-use interface to manage various aspects of an organization's human resources. Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on departments, roles, and employees; although some interactions have not been fulfilled.

* The commit's history will show a different approach based on express.js but this application did not require that. Instead, I used a direct simple approach by just calling the cli.js file with the prompts and logic.

## Installation
Just in the CLI execute 'npm install'.
If you would like to work with this project, there is a .env file that you must set with your own password and use the DB_PASSWORD variable in the MySQL connection. Don't forget to add that file (.env) in your .gitignore file.
